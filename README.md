The design are linked to my blog that explains many techniques on how to write good RTL  [Blog Link](https://sites.google.com/view/autonomousvision/blog?authuser=0).

In this repository I include various RTL designs using SystemVerilog HDL. Futher, I build verification environment using Yosys formal suite along with the simulation based testbench.
This will follow my #100DaysofRTL challenge on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=100daysofrtl).
