# Synchronous Memory with Data Forwarding

The implemented synchronous memory IP performs the read and the write to locations.
- Reading and writing to the same location results in new write value at the output.
- This is implemented internally by performing data forwarding.

Below, the timing diagram is shown where read and write to the same address is checked.
